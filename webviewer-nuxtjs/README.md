# WebViewer Nuxt 2 Sample

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse PDF SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

This repo is specifically designed for any users interested in integrating WebViewer into a [Nuxt 2](https://v2.nuxt.com/) project. This project was created using the `npm init nuxt-app` command and uses the [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) UI Framework as well as the [Axios](https://v2.nuxt.com/examples/modules/axios/) NuxtJS module, which provides a promise based HTTP client.
