# WebViewer Nuxt 2 Sample

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that enables you to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs and other document types inside any web project.

- [WebViewer Demo](https://showcase.apryse.com/)

This sample is specifically designed for any users interested in integrating WebViewer into a [Nuxt 2](https://v2.nuxt.com/) project. This project was created using the `npm init nuxt-app` command and uses the [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) UI Framework as well as the [Axios](https://v2.nuxt.com/examples/modules/axios/) NuxtJS module, which provides a promise based HTTP client.
