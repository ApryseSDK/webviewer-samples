# WebViewer Video

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that enables you to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs and other document types inside any web project.

This sample uses the [video addon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdftron/webviewer-video) for WebViewer. It allows the loading of HTML5 videos (.mp4, ogg, webm) so that their frames can be annotated. For more information, see this [guide](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started/manually-video).
